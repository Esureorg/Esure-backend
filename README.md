# Esure Backend

The API and scenario runner for Esure, an open-source testing toolkit for
Stellar payments.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- Network access to Stellar Testnet for live runs

## Setup

```bash
npm install
copy .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3001` by default.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # start with file watching
npm run build      # compile TypeScript
npm test           # run unit/API tests
npm run typecheck  # check types without emitting files
npm run check      # typecheck and test
```

The default runner limits each step to 30 seconds, each run to 120 seconds,
and concurrent execution to two runs. Request rates, in-memory retention, body
size, and concurrency are configurable through the bounded values documented in
`.env.example`.

## Initial endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/v1/scenarios`
- `GET /api/v1/scenarios/:scenarioId`
- `POST /api/v1/scenarios/validate`
- `POST /api/v1/runs`
- `POST /api/v1/runs/definitions`
- `GET /api/v1/runs/:runId`
- `GET /api/v1/runs/:runId/report`
- `GET /openapi.json`

Start a live Testnet run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/runs \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenarioId":"issued-asset-payment","inputs":{}}'
```

Run state is currently stored in memory and is lost when the process restarts.
Generated Testnet secret keys are held only during execution and are never
included in responses or reports.

Bundled scenarios are declarative files in `scenarios/`. Set
`SCENARIO_DIRECTORY` to load additional bounded JSON/YAML definitions at startup,
or submit a definition directly to `/api/v1/runs/definitions`. Definitions are
validated before account generation or network access. See
`../esure-docs/SCENARIOS.md` and `/openapi.json` for Schema v1 and API details.

Run the opt-in live smoke test only when real Testnet access is intended:

macOS / Linux:

```bash
RUN_STELLAR_SMOKE=1 npm test -- test/testnet-smoke.test.ts
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:RUN_STELLAR_SMOKE="1"
npm test -- test/testnet-smoke.test.ts
Remove-Item Env:RUN_STELLAR_SMOKE
```

The same smoke test runs on a daily GitHub Actions schedule. Normal pull-request
tests remain deterministic and make no external network calls.

## Safety

The runner is locked to Stellar Testnet. Scenario Schema v1 accepts only
generated accounts, native/issued assets, `changeTrust`, and `payment`. It
rejects secret seeds, arbitrary transaction envelopes, URLs, scripts, raw XDR,
unknown properties, unresolved references, and definitions above its resource
budgets.
